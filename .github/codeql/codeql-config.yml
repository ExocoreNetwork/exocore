  # This rule is ignored because it is too noisy. Although it is valid in
  # many contexts, it is not valid in the most common usage of
  # `store = ctx.KVStore; store.Set(key, value)` since KVStore uses
  # a parent in-memory cached multistore obtained from `baseapp.go`.
  # The in-memory caching, before being written to the IAVL+ tree,
  # sorts the keys internally and hence the order does not impact consistency.
