# This workflow runs on every push and pull request to the repository.
# It then calculates the unit test coverage and checks if it's above a certain threshold.
# this information is passed on to another workflow as artifacts for commenting on the PR.
# This is because the `pull_request` event does not have the commenting permissions.
# We could switch to `pull_request_target` which does have them, however, it
# opens a security hole. See:
