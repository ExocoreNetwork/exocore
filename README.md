# exocore

Exocore is an omnichain restaking protocol that combines the crypto-economic security from multiple blockchain networks and tokens, and extends it to any off-chain system. The protocol is designed with a modular architecture, incorporating Tendermint-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism, Zero-Knowledge (ZK) light-client bridging, and a fully EVM-compatible execution environment. This design enables smooth interactions for restakers and seamless integration for developers. Additionally, we introduce novel concepts, such as Union Restaking, where off-chain services can form a union to extend the crypto-economic security of their own tokens to each other. By pooling crypto-economic security and extending it to off-chain systems, Exocore powers an open market for decentralized trust.

## Creating docker images
1. Once the dependencies are installed, execute
`make localnet-init`, this will generate the cluster configuration file.
2. Run the following command to create the docker image:
    ```bash
    make localnet-build
    # Check if images build done
    docker images
    ```
3. Launch the chain node:
    ```bash
    make localnet-start
    # Check if containers are all up
    docker ps
    ```
## Interacting with a local node
With a node running, the exocored binary can be used to interact with the node. Run `./bin/exocored <command> --help` to get information about the available commands.
