# the module logic to be done

## common

* use evm tx as the only entry for any exocore operation
* implement the invariant logic for every module to keep the state security
* setting module parameter needs to be done through governance proposal
* pay attention to each module's state when the EVM transaction fails.
* consider which operations require depositing some exocore tokens to maintain security

## deposit

## delegation

* delegateTo and undelegateFrom might also need to be implemented using exocore as entry
* Need to check the input parameters and deposit some exocore token when register to an operator
* the operator can only be registered once
* delegateTo might require the approval of operator to grant the operator permission for selecting a staking user

## restaking_assets_manage

* implement the registration of client chain and assets through the governance proposal instead of setting in the genesis

## withdraw

## reward
* consider storing the reward state in its own module state

## exoslash
* record the slash states of all operators
* provide the function to deploy slash condition for AVS
* provide the function to approve the slash condition deployed by the AVS(to be decided)
* provide the function to submit slash proof


## AVS opted-in
* record the operator opted-in information
